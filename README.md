### ✨ What is this?  
Hey there! I’m a Ball State student who, like many of you, was pretty bummed when **my.bsu.edu** was replaced at the end of 2024. So, I decided to do something about it!  

This is an **open-source revival** of the classic **my.bsu.edu** page. Since the original was a login-only site (and there’s no archived version 😅), this project is inspired by its layout and vibe. The best part? It’s open-source, so you can tweak it and make it look as close to the original as you remember—or better!

### 🤔 Why revive it?  
Let’s be honest: **MyBallState** just isn’t it.  
- The layout? 🚫 Wonky and confusing.  
- The experience? 😤 Logs you out constantly (Duo, anyone?).  
- The app? 📱 Barely worth the storage space—it’s just as frustrating as the website.  

I miss the simplicity and ease of **my.bsu.edu**, and I figured I couldn’t be the only one. So here we are!
